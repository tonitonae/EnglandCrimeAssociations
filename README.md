# Association Rule Mining for reported street crimes in England & Wales

This is a fork of [this code](https://github.com/AlistairLR112/EnglandCrimeAssociations) (good job!).

The objective of this repository is to provide a version of the study which is able to run on Google Colab out of the box. Thus, I also include in the repository the data file and the notebook automatically downloads and uncompresses it within the VM. Data was originally downloaded from [here](https://data.police.uk/data/) and is redistributed with permission as stated in its [license](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).
